<p style="color:black ;text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; ;font-family:sans-serif ; ">The currency of Bangladesh has depreciated further against the US dollar, hitting Tk 92.50 on the interbank platform yesterday.

    The exchange rate stood at Tk 92 per dollar on Monday before falling by Tk 0.50 on Tuesday, the 13th decline alone this year.
    In order to prevent a massive fall of the taka, the Bangladesh Bank injected $105 million into the market yesterday to help banks settle import bills, a central bank official said.

    The central bank supplied a record $6.79 billion to the market between July 1 and June 13 this fiscal year. Still, the foreign exchange market is facing a shortage of US dollars due to the soaring import payments and the declining trend of remittance.</p>
